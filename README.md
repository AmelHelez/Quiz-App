### About the app
The application is a quiz-shopping application, which comprises of three screens: welcome, questions, and report screens. The questions screen has three parts, but the same functionality. First part displays houses for rent, second cars for sale, and third clothing. Each part must have one selected option before going to the next part. After the questions screen is completed, the user is redirected to the last - report - screen. Here, the user sees a weekly spend and a total cost calculated using the selected options from the second screen. Moreover, the report screen depicts what type of spender the user is: Compulsive Saver, In Betweener, or Compulsive Spender. Each option can be edited, and the results updated as well.
